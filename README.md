# File Encryption Project

A simple C++ console application that allows users to encrypt, decrypt, and view text files.
This project demonstrates basic file handling, class implementation, and a Caesar Cipherâ€“style encryption.

# Features

ðŸ”¸ Encrypt a File â€” Shifts all characters to make the text unreadable.

ðŸ”¸ Decrypt a File â€” Restores the original readable text.

ðŸ”¸ Display File Contents â€” Prints the current content of the file.

ðŸ”¸ Change File â€” Lets you switch to another file anytime.

# How It Works

The program uses a simple ASCII shift encryption:

Operation	Formula	Example
Encryption	ch = ch + 2	A â†’ C, b â†’ d
Decryption	ch = ch - 2	C â†’ A, d â†’ b

This basic logic scrambles the content of the file and restores it back later.

# Class Overview
class Encryption
Method	Description
setFileName()	Prompts the user for a file name.
encrypt()	Encrypts file content by shifting ASCII values by +2.
decrypt()	Decrypts file content by reversing the shift (âˆ’2).
display()	Displays the contents of the file.


# Menu Options

When you run the program, youâ€™ll see this menu:

5. Exit
Enter your choice: 


# Before Encryption (original content):
Hello World!
This is a test file.


# After Encryption:

# After Decryption:
Hello World!
This is a test file.
